### Count the occurrence of keys and convert the result into array of objects where each object belongs to one key and it's occurrence (count).

#### Example
```js
[
    { language: 'JavaScript' },{ language: 'JavaScript' },{ language: 'TypeScript' },
] 
```

#### SHOULD BE CONVERTED TO =
```js
[
{ language: 'JavaScript', count: 2 },
{ language: 'C++', count: 1 },
{ language: 'TypeScript', count: 1 }
]
```

##### The idea is to count the frequency of each unique key in an array of objects and then instead of making the result look like 
```js
{ key1: 2, key2: 1, key3: 7 } 
```
The result should be an array of objects so that it can be map over and get rendered in React.JS or something like that.
```js
[ { key1: 2 }, { key2: 1 }, { key3: 7 } ]
```
